# Hidden-Rickroll
A script that I made based on the usb rubber ducky payload https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---rickroll that runs natively on windows.

The .bat files are the scripts and the .exe file is the final version
The one that runs at startup doesn't work right now but I will try to get it working.
